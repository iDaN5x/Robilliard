This repo contains the source files of my graduation project at electronics class.</br>
The project was built in collaboration with a friend and two idiots.
</p><p>
The project consisted of two parts:
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Image processing, and controling unit (Master):</strong>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The robot's hardware beahviour script (Slave):</strong>
    Hardware behaviour description written in VHDL. This part was not written by me, but by the two idiots. It is badly written, berely working, and partly broken, and therfore I won't include it here.
  </li>
</ol>
</p><p>
BEWARE - this is not a finished product, and is working partly due to development time limitations.</br>
Also, As of the VHDL being partly missing I would not include them here (atleast until I'll find them.
</p><p>
Each piece of code in this project contains a little documentation, describing
